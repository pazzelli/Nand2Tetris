# Tic Tac Toe Game
### For the Hack Computer as part of the Nand2Tetris Project
**Copyright (c) 2013, John Pazzelli**

This is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game on the Hack computer as part of the Nand2Tetris project.  The game features a 1 or 2-player mode with a computer-controlled player for single player games.  The computer AI uses a 'minimax' algorithm and has 3 levels of difficulty - the **Impossible mode** is **unbeatable**!

## Instructions
1. Download the [Nand2Tetris software suite](http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php) and follow the setup instructions.

2. Download the [TicTacToe.zip](https://github.com/pazzelli/Nand2Tetris/blob/master/TicTacToe.zip) file and unzip to a local directory

3. Open the *Virtual Machine emulator* supplied with the Nand2Tetris software files from step 1 (run the */tools/VMEmulator.bat* (Windows) or */tools/VMEmulator.sh* (Unix/Linux) file)

4. Choose *File --> Load Program* and select the directory from step 2 where the Tic Tac Toe game files are stored

## Background (taken from www.nand2tetris.org)
The Nand2Tetris project contains all the software tools and project materials necessary to build a general-purpose computer system from the ground up. We also provide a set of lectures designed to support a typical course on the subject.

The materials also support two courses that we now teach in Coursera:

**Nand2Tetris Part I - Hardware**
1. Boolean Functions and Gate Logic
2. Boolean Arithmetic and the ALU
3. Memory
4. Machine Language
5. Computer Architecture
6. Assembler

**Nand2Tetris Part II - Software**
1. Virtual Machine I - Stack Arithmetic
2. Virtual Machine II - Program Control
3. Compiler I - Syntax Analysis
4. Compiler II - Code Generation
5. Operating System
6. High-Level Language and Custom Project
